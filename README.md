# Image lithography
Hide files or text inside an image.<br><br>
This project was inspired by a ["programming mission"](www.hackthissite.org/missions/prog/2/) 
of [hackthissite](www.hackthissite.org)<br> 
it uses the [pillow library](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) for reading/creating images 
and [simple-crypt](https://pypi.org/project/simple-crypt/) for encryption/decryption<br><br>
You can create images out of mostly random colored pixels to hide your text and use a "keys"-file to show  which pixels are relevant 
(comparable to the mission mentioned before)<br>
You can also hide text or even files in existing images. You have the option to encrypt your data using simplecrypt.
