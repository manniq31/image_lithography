# Image Steganography
Hide files or text inside an image.<br><br>
This project was inspired by a ["programming mission"](http://www.hackthissite.org/missions/prog/2/) 
of [hackthissite](http://www.hackthissite.org)<br> 
it uses the [pillow library](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) for reading/creating images 
and [simple-crypt](https://pypi.org/project/simple-crypt/) for encryption/decryption<br><br>
You can create images out of mostly random colored pixels to hide your text and use a "keys"-file to show  which pixels are relevant 
(comparable to the mission mentioned before)<br>
You can also hide text or even files in existing images with the option to encrypt your data using simplecrypt.<br><br>
The Program can be used with an interactive dialog or with commandline arguments
